Website by Skye Moffitt, Nancy Draganowski, and Veronica Gaskin - The Honey Bees - from McNairy Central High School

Skye worked on the sandwiches and bbq pages of the website. She gathered most of the images for the whole site. She also did visits and interviews with the owner of Patriot Pizza, making sure we had all the correct information for the site. Her biggest challenge in creating the site was finding satisfactory images to use for the website.

Nancy worked on the entirety of the drinks menu page, getting high quality images, making sure the menu was accurate, and creating a layout that is pleasing to the eye. She also contributed to the bbq and sandwiches pages of the website, making sure the layout looked nice and spelling was correct. Nancy's main challenge was figuring out what layout worked best in creating the drink menu, and she eventually found out what worked best through repeated trial and error until she reached a satisfying result.

Veronica worked on the entire CSS structure of the website, making sure the design was consistent throughout all the pages. She also worked on the layout for the home page and pizza menu page. Her main challenge was using the flexbox system, but over time she figured out how to use it consistently and accurately, making the website better overall.

We all worked together on the quick lunch page, debating on what images worked best and how to lay out the individual items on the page. Using good teamwork, we eventually decided on a layout that was appealing to everyone in the group.

We look forard to working with our client as they publish this site publically and begin using it as part of their marketing strategy.
